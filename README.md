```

The video will be saved to `~/Downloads/insta-videos/` by default.

### Custom Filename

You can specify a custom filename (without extension):

```bash
insta-download https://www.instagram.com/reels/DIYBrhAhmNS/ -o cool_cat_video
```

This will save the file as `~/Downloads/insta-videos/cool_cat_video.mp4`.

## Technical Details

This tool uses the Instagram Looter 2 API via RapidAPI to fetch video information. It then downloads the video directly from Instagram's servers.

### API Key Security

The tool stores your API key securely in a `.env` file which is ignored by git to prevent accidental exposure. Make sure to:

1. Never commit your `.env` file to version control
2. Keep your API key private
3. Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised

## Limitations

- Only works with public Instagram posts
- Instagram's API changes may affect functionality
- Rate limits may apply based on your RapidAPI plan
